# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game using Arduino

This project is a physical version of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game, built using **Arduino Nano**, **servo motors**, and sensors. It simulates human hand gestures using mechanical fingers and allows player interaction via sensors and inputs.

## Components Used
- Arduino Nano  
- 3x Servo Motors  
- Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Potentiometer  
- LED Display  
- Breadboard, jumper wires  
- Arduino IDE for coding and uploading firmware

##  How It Works
- **Servo motors** mimic the three hand gestures: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- **Ultrasonic sensor** detects opponent presence to start the game.
- **Potentiometer** is used by the player to change the sensitivity of LCD display.
- The result is displayed using the **LED display**.
- Game logic is implemented using Arduino IDE.
